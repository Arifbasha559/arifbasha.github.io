        <p>A web designer creates the layout and design of a website. In simple terms, a website designer makes a site look good. They use design programs to create visual elements. Website designers usually have expertise in UI, or user interface, which means they strategically design a site that’s intuitive and easy for visitors to navigate. </p>

        <p>    The aesthetics of a website directly impact a user’s opinion of the site and the company. As a website designer, your work could directly impact a company’s reputation. Research shows it takes website visitors less than one second to judge a website, and that first impression is often associated with the brand as well. Seventy-five percent of consumers admit to judging a brand’s credibility based on its website, according to Kinesis [1]</p>
            
        <p>    As a result, companies are putting more emphasis on website design, and it’s reflected in the job market. Jobs in this field are growing 13-percent faster than the national average, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics [2].</p>
